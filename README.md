# income-prediction
This project utilizes the incomeData.csv dataset, which contains records related to individual or household income data. The dataset is likely structured with features such as age, education, occupation, gender, and income level, which are commonly found in demographic income analysis. It is used here for data analysis and visualization using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Key objectives of this notebook include:

# Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
# Exploring distributions and trends across demographic features.
# Visualizing relationships and identifying income patterns.
